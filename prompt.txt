A dynamic and visually appealing representation of portfolio optimization using SciPy. The image should combine elements of data visualization (e.g., a stylized graph showing portfolio performance), financial symbols (e.g., stock tickers, currency signs), and abstract representations of algorithms and optimization processes (e.g., glowing lines converging on a solution). The overall tone should be modern, sophisticated, and indicative of data-driven decision-making in finance. Consider a color palette of blues, greens, and golds to convey trust, growth, and value.

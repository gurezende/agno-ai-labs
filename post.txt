Unlock Your Best Self Through Healthy Eating:

1. Prioritize whole foods: Load up on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.  They’re packed with nutrients and keep you feeling full and energized.

2. Mindful eating:  Pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues. Avoid distractions while eating.

3. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate: Water is crucial for digestion, energy levels, and overall health.

4. Don’t deprive yourself:  Allow for occasional treats.  Deprivation can lead to overeating later.  Enjoy everything in moderation!

5. Plan ahead:  Prep your meals or snacks in advance to avoid unhealthy impulse decisions.

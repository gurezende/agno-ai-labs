1. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods: Fill your plate with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. 
2. Hydrate consistently:  Water is essential for countless bodily functions. Aim for at least eight glasses a day.
3. Mindful eating: Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Savor your meals and avoid distractions.

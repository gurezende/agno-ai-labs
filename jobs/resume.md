EXPERIENCE

2024 – 2025
Projects with Artificial Intelligence
Data Dictionary GenAI: Developed an AI-powered tool to generate data dictionaries using LLMs, improving data documentation efficiency. 
Data Pipeline AI: An AI-powered application to interact with flight prices data stored in a PostgreSQL database. It offers two main functionalities: updating the database with new flight prices and querying the database using natural language through AI assistants.
Agno AI Labs: Led a series of experiments with AI Agents, applying transformer-based architectures to various NLP tasks. 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system combining LLMs with external files, providing a QA bot to interact with the uploaded file.
Pipeline DuckDB and AI: Developed the ETL integrating an API to extract the data, transformed it with DuckDB for efficient data transformation and storage, and generated an automated report powered with AI for summarization and recommendations. 

2020 – 2024
Data Scientist | Food Lion | Salisbury, NC
Led model tuning and validation efforts, incorporating A/B testing and statistical techniques to ensure model robustness and business alignment.
Applied customer segmentation techniques using algorithms like PCA combined with KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Model.
Implemented an optimization algorithm that reduced labor and space in stores' front-end by up to 30%.
Partnered with cross-functional teams to implement dashboards for HR incident tracking, enabling secure and compliant reporting.
Created data quality checks and built data pipelines in PySpark and SQL, ensuring integrity across e-commerce systems.
Developed and tuned models using regression and time series approaches to forecast store traffic, reducing percent error to under 2%.
Designed and implemented ETL pipelines in Databricks, improving data quality and system integration, leading to a 20% increase in store selection accuracy.

# Getting Started with AI Agents using Agno

![](img/helping_agent.jpeg)

This document provides a guide to the foundational concepts and code examples for building AI Agents using Python, with a focus on the Agno library.

## The Basics of AI Agents

An AI Agent is essentially a Large Language Model (LLM) empowered with the ability to interact with external tools and perform actions. This goes beyond simple chatbots, enabling agents to automate tasks such as scheduling, managing calendars, searching the internet, and even executing entire Data Science workflows.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into the code, ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install agno google-generativeai groq lancedb sentence-transformers tantivy youtube-transcript-api
```

## Basic Agent

This code snippet showcases the fundamental steps involved in creating an AI Agent with Agno. It initializes an agent powered by the Gemini model and instructs it to provide weather information for New York City in a markdown table format.

## Code Explanation

* Imports the Agent class from the `agno.agent` module. This class is the core component for creating AI agents in Agno.
* Imports the Gemini class from the `agno.models.google` module. This class represents the Gemini language model from Google, which will power our agent.
* Imports the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, including accessing environment variables.

Next, we will create the agent using the `Agent` class.

* `model`: This parameter specifies the Language Learning Model that the agent will use. Here, we are initializing a Gemini model:
id="gemini-1.5-flash": Specifies the ID of the Gemini model to be used.
* `api_key = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")`: Retrieves the Google Gemini API key from the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY. Ensure you have this environment variable set before running the script.
* `description`: A brief description of the agent's purpose ("An assistant agent").
* `instructions`: A list of instructions given to the agent to guide its behavior. In this case, the agent is instructed to be concise and return the output as a markdown table.
* `expected_output`: Describes the expected format of the agent's response ("A table with month, season and average temperature"). This can help the agent understand the desired output structure.
* `markdown=True`: Indicates that the agent should format its output as markdown.

```python
agent.run("What's the weather like in NYC for each month of the year?")
```

This line executes the agent with a specific query: *"What's the weather like in NYC for each month of the year?"*.<br>
The run() method sends this query to the configured Gemini model.

```python
print(response.content)
```

This line prints the content attribute of the response object. The response object contains the output generated by the Gemini model based on the query and the agent's configuration. Since markdown=True was set during agent creation, the output is expected to be a markdown table.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Install the necessary libraries
2. Get the necessary API Keys (e.g. Gemini, OpenAI)
3. Save the code with a name of your choice: **file_name.py**.
4. Run the script.

```bash
python file_name.py
```
